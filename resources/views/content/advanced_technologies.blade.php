    <div>In addition to the IoT network of water flow and water quality sensors installed throughout the
        Farm Platform, we are testing a variety of sensor and sensor communication technologies. Some
        that provide data at a local data collection level and those that can be fully integrated using
        various communication approaches such as Low Power, Wide Area (LPWA) networking using the
        LoRaWAN protocol or Narrow Band. Some examples of current sensor deployments are given below,
        and </div>

    <h2>Current Studies</h2>
    <h3>Air Quality</h3>
    <div><strong>Methane emissions</strong></div>
    <div>Enteric methane (CH4) emissions from freely-grazing animals are measured using a harmless
        tracer gas technique. The well-established method relies on a known source of the synthetic
        inert tracer, sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), that is inserted into the rumen as a bolus. The SF6
        tracer technique works on the basis that excretions of two gases sourced from the rumen disperse
        identically into the animal's environment, and thus have identical probability of interception
        by a simple 'breath' sampler located near the nasal cavity and fitted to a halter. The samples
        of breath are analysed in the laboratory. This technique is enabling the unknown release rate of
        CH4 to be estimated. </div>

    <h3>Water Harvesting </h3>
    <div><strong>SmartPond</strong></div>
    <div>SDS Water Infrastructure Systems are interested in using smart technology to control the
        release and retention of water principally with an interest to alleviate flooding. They use
        models and weather forecasts to predict future rain events, prior to them occurring, and their
        technology is designed to release stored water, thereby creating increased water storage
        capacity. This storage can then be utilised to retain water during the high fall event to reduce
        risks of downstream or sewer flooding.</div>
    <div>Currently and as part of another ERDF Impact Lab project, SDS are using shed roof rainwater
        sited at the Farm Platform livestock buildings as a test bed for their new IoT-based technology.
        Rainwater falling on the Rowden and Whiddon Down livestock buildings flows into harvesting
        tanks, and release of the water is remotely controlled in order to optimise water use (say,
        through efficient use of water for field spraying).</div>
    <div>Further work is planned, where SDS will use the roof rainwater lagoon at Rowden Buildings as a
        test bed for their new technology. Currently rainwater falling on the Rowden buildings currently
        flows into one small lagoon, from the lagoon its release is controlled using a traditional
        'non-smart' hydro brake vortex flow control. SDS would like to replace the hydro brake with
        their own technology which will allow them to vary the speed water is released or retained
        within the lagoon.</div>

    <h3>Animal Health, Welfare and Behaviour</h3>
    <h5><strong>Cattle</strong></h5>
    <div><strong>Behaviour and activity</strong></div>
    <div>Cattle movement and activity using GPS and pedometers are used to further our understanding of
        a range of aspects of pasture-based beef production systems including behaviour, welfare,
        performance, and emissions. With these devices we can map where the animals have been grazing
        and overlay this information on a range of different measured variables such as pasture quality,
        livestock performance, dung and urine deposits, and gaseous emissions such as methane. Data form
        the animals can be automatically collected whilst they are in the field or in housing. For
        example, we are monitoring step count, standing time, lying time, standing bouts and lying bouts
        using a mobile, trailer mounted CowAlert system provided by IceRobotics Ltd to capture and
        download data from leg-mounted IceQube pedometers in-situ from grazing dairy x beef cattle to

        <div><strong>Water usage</strong></div>
        <div>Using LoRaWAN enabled water meters, we can measure and compare water usage in a rotational cell
            grazing system uses very small, mobile drinking troughs with a conventional
            set-stocked/continuous grazing system which uses typical large, static water troughs. Photo
            would be nice</div>

        <div><strong>Drinking behaviour, health and welfare</strong></div>
        <div>Understanding changes in rumen temperature using a temperature bolus enables us to understand
            how life events may influence cattle health, welfare and productivity. Commonly used within the
            dairy industry, the temperature bolus is administered orally and stays in the rumen throughout
            the life of the animal. As an example of this methodology, we are using LoRaWAN enabled
            temperature sensors to monitor the temperature of drinking water in differing grazing management
            systems in combination with rumen temperature boluses to investigate whether grazing
            management/drinking trough design effects drinking behaviour of cattle.</div>

        <h3>Remote sensing</h3>
        <div><strong>Current capacity and call for collaborations</strong></div>
        <div>Currently, North Wyke has limited remote sensing capability but is eager to enhance this part
            of its research. Aims are to capture remotely sensed data from a range of scales from the
            platform's forage harvester (a CIEL funded project - <a href="https://www.cielivestock.co.uk/"
                onclick="window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=yes,toolbar=no,menubar=yes,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=yes,dependent=no'); return false;">https://www.cielivestock.co.uk/</a>)
            to drones (we currently have two devices with licence holders and links to the GrassCheckGB
            project -<a href="http://www.grasscheckgb.co.uk/"
                onclick="window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=yes,toolbar=no,menubar=yes,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=yes,dependent=no'); return false;">
                www.grasscheckgb.co.uk</a> ) to satellite platforms in order to monitor biomass dynamics
            according field grass/crop cover type and also field livestock type.</div>
        <div>This can be combined with drone-based SfM photogrammetry and airborne LiDAR for sward
            characterisation and the system's Carbon assessment. Drone sensing approaches exploiting
            fine-grained thermal imaging systems can be used to map fam platform sub-catchment hydrology and
            alongside targeted fine-grained multispectral drone surveys can be used to map urine patches
            that drive greenhouse gas emissions such as N2O. All such data can in turn, inform nutrient
            content, quality and loss, and livestock performance.</div>

            This study is in collaboration with Rob Clement (University of Edinburgh), and Dr Hill
            (Exeter University) who designed a prototype of a low-cost system which promises to
            reduce
            the cost of Eddy Covariance (EC) by an order of magnitude, making wide-spread use of
            this
            instrumentation economically feasible. The prototype has undergone some testing at field
            sites in Morecambe Bay and Dumfries and Galloway. The second-generation system now
            requires
            testing, and the technique needs be proven at a wider range of field sites.</div>

        is to develop a network of AI-enabled water and soil sensors across the Farm Platform.
        British Telecom (BT) have enabled a Narrow-Band IoT Radio Network across its Mobile
        Network
        cell(s) which cover the Farm Platform. This facilitates communication with the installed
        sensor network. BT have also developed an IoT data processing facility to land, process,
        transform, store and publish the data on the its web platform. The aim of the project is
        to
        develop an understanding of the use of low power radio, low cost sensors and AI to
        deliver
        high frequency insights for on-farm use.</div>

        Initially, water conductivity sensors will be installed in the flow cells within the
        flume
        cabins on each of the 5 blue treatment catchments. The sensors are battery powered and
        will
        utilise the NB-IoT radio module which will link the sensor data to the BT IoT Platform.
        The
        sensors will be co-located with the current water quality instrumentation including YSI
        conductivity sensors. The project will compare the current (high cost) and new sensor
        (low
        cost) data output.</div>

        The conductivity sensors will be used to develop AI-enabled water quality monitoring.
        One of
        the hypotheses of this project is that through using AI, it is possible to determine a
        variety of chemical &amp; biological parameters through modelling only a small subset of
        sensor measurements. Here a conductivity sensor will be used to derive 20 new
        physical/biological properties. Some measurements can be validated through comparison
        with
        sensor data from the current Farm Platform instrumentation, others not. The second stage
        of
        the project will install AI-enabled soil sensors across the Farm Platform. </div>

        We are testing the hypothesis that the in-situ high-resolution technique (first tested
        in a
        laboratory set-up in Luxembourg, LIST) is suitable for obtaining high-frequency
        measurements
        of sediment properties at the flume outlet under natural runoff conditions. The main
        application to test in this research is the Spectro::lyser sensor. This sensor emits a
        light
        beam through an open path, through which water and sediment flows. The sensor measure
        absorbance (as influenced by the water and sediment). In this research, the absorbance
        values measured will be related to the sediment (properties) in the water transported
        through the flume outlet. </div>

        Results of the absorbance measurements will be validated by two different methods. The
        first
        method includes taking soil samples, sieving them, and creating water and sediment
        solutions
        under lab conditions (with different concentrations of sediments added) to test the
        absorbance signal under controlled conditions. In this way, absorbance of the same
        sediments
        can be compared (under natural conditions/influence, and under completely controlled
        conditions in the lab [only sediments and blank water]). </div>

        The second validation method of the in-field absorbance spectra uses the sediments
        captured
        by the automatic water sampler. Results from the Spectro::lyser (installed at the field
        outlet) are related to those times samples are taken by the automatic water sampler. The
        sediment from this automatic sampler will be analysed (e.g. for colour properties,
        chemical
        properties) to validate the absorbance readings of the Spectro::lyser at the
        corresponding
        times. In both methods, the goal is to see to what extent absorbance measurements in
        situ
        (influenced by natural conditions) relate to the mobilised sediment and its properties.
